You can see that utilizing the intext:{company name} inurl:amazonaws.com 
	- intext: We are able to specify any names, file extensions, etc. that may be included within that cloud google search.
	- inurl: Specifying the URL that it originated from. 

We can utilize **domain.glass** to tell us more about the URL, it is a WHOIS DNS Lookup tool. **GrayHatWarfare** is another tool that we can use to accomplish gathering more information.
