1. Download installation .iso from Red Hat Linux site. 
	1. https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/7.9/x86_64/product-software
2. Ensure that you have Virtualization software installed on computer. 
	1. VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
3. Create new virtual machine with the following parameters

	3. Hard Drive Space: 40GB
4. Mount .iso file to the newly created VM
5. Start Up Virtual Machine and hit "Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
	1. This will boot into a GUI that we can then make specific user permissions and OS Hard Drive modifications.
6. Change the root password
	1. Personally, I would just set the password to "root" and call it a day. 
7. Set partitions to automatic
8. Watch the magic happen.... 
	1. Magic takes about 10-15 Mins to complete the OS installation, so give it some time.
